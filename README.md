# Vehicle Management System

The purpose of the system is to provide tools for vehicle management. Initially, it includes a fuel log, an odometer
comparison (factory original vs. current), a tire pressure calculator (based on the original pressure), and a fuel
consumption tracker. The system is powered by a .csv file that stores vehicle data (including original tire measurements
and current tire measurements). The system also keeps an updated .csv file that logs fuel fill-ups (used to calculate
fuel consumption).
